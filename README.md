### Polygon
the contract addresses are above.
- A tool for DAO asset management was implemented on Polygon.
- Until now, the DAOs have simply transferred money in batches to project leaders and others in projects where budget decisions have been made. There was a problem with transparency due to the possibility of confusion with personal assets, the possibility of being hacked, and not knowing which transactions were related to the project. We created a wallet that allowed DAOs to specify which contracts they could use to transfer money to the budget executor, keeping it separate from the rest of the budget.
- Contributors have peace of mind and identity by SBT.
